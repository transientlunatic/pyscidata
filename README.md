data-loaders
============

Handling science data is a bore; there's no standardised way of retrieving or storing most forms of data, and there are dozens of ways of loading it into Python. This is an attempt to improve this situation slightly, by producing hand-curated scripts to download data, and turn it into a format suitable for processing in Python.
